## 🔍 What Is an EFT Aimbot?

An **EFT aimbot** is a cheat tool that automatically locks your aim onto targets, turning any weapon — even budget builds — into pinpoint precision machines. Whether you want to *rage with headshots* or *play it smooth and subtle*, an aimbot has your back.

This cheat is a core feature in most premium Escape from Tarkov hack menus, usually bundled with ESP, no recoil, and radar.
